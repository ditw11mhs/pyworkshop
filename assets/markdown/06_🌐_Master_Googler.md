## The Power of Internet

Internet is vast landscape and super highway of information. In your journey to learn program and in the face of hurdle you are going to be friend with the internet one way or another.

## Google How To's

It is okay to Google things out, even senior developer Google their way out of some situations. The things that differentiate beginner and senior developer is the way they Google stuff, I'll give you some tips that I've learn from a few years Googling my way out of problems.

### Tips #0: Stackoverflow

Stackoverflow is maybe one of the best place to ask things, but usually you don't need to ask things, 99% of the time people already ask the same question, so when you Google things out the result showing Stackoverflow might be your best shot to get the answer for your question.

### Tips #1 : Always state the programming language or library you are using while googling

This might be a no brainer but a lot of times people search what they need without stating the language they are using, this contribute to unrelated search result that made it harder to find good answer.

i.e. How to flatten list of list in python

### Tips #2 : Copy paste the error

Sometimes error are one google away, it's almost certain that someone came to the error before you, so just copy paste the error and you'll find it easier to solve the error.

i.e. TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

### Tips #3 : Check the library's documentation

All of big and great libray came with documentation, it is the place to find how function work and what you can do with that function. Sometimes error came from we the programmer that don't really understand how things work out, checking the documentation is the second thing you do if you can't find related question from Stackoverflow

## Github

Github is a place for hosting your software development and also do version control with them. In Github you can find a lot of stuff people made in all programming language. But why use Github?

### Source of Knowledge

Other than stackoverflow, you can search things up in Github, but not in a way that you think. A lot of library that I stated from the chapter before is mainly hosted in Github, you can check out their repository (The place they store the actual code), and find issues that maybe related to your error

### Portofolio

Use github to make a portofolio, it's basically a social media for developers. You can show off your project through github

### Open Source and Licensing

Most of the stuff you see in Github is open source or licensed. So it's better to check the licensing of the stuff you are using, plagiarism isn't tolerated well anywhere so check things out before you copy things from github.

### Easy Solo and Team Development

Github is meant to be a place that you can develop program together in a team, you can even contribute to big repository by following the how-to's there. You can use github for your solo project too, even the homework you are doing. You can easily use Github to help with roll back or just essentially use it as a cloud to store your code.

There are a lot of things to talk about Git and Github, I recommend you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) made by FreeCodeCamp talking about Git and Github.

## TLDR

- To get through the problem and question while programming, the Internet is a way to search things out
- Be more aware with how and where you search for things while going through your hurdle, it'll be more efficient if you do a specific search rather than a too general questions
- Github is a platform for dev to store their code and collaborate, this can be one of the many source to your answer while programming
- You can use Github to store your code and making portofolio of your work
