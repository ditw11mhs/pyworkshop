## Python - easy to learn, hard to master

Python is one of the easiest programming language out there that is easy to learn. But the same with any other language it is hard to master.

There are still a lot of things to learn ranging from programming paradigm, advanced OOP and program testing that you'll learn on this long humbling journey. There are also a lot of specialization that you can do using Python. I'll list a few and also the things you need to start learning.

### Web Development

Web development can be easily divided with frontend and backend.

Frontend development is the development of a website visual. The visualization of a website is what the frontend developer do. It is usually implemented in HTML and CSS with Javascript for the added interactibility. Python frontend framework usually replace the Javascript with Python while leaving HTML and CSS alone. One of the most popular frontend framework in Python is Django. Django is a "battery-included" library with a lot of built in things. If you are interested in frontend development you can check Django own website [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Backend Development is the development of the unseen things behind web or app usually called API. API is an interface that the frontend can talk to, and it'll do what the frontend needed ranging from authentication, database manipulation and a lot more. Two of the most popular backend framework in Python is FastAPI and Flask. Both of them got their own pros and cons, but in the end they do the same thing, being the interface between the frontend with database and a lot more moving part behind the scene. You can check FastAPI [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and Flask [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)

### Data Scientist, Analytics and Engineering

For this kind of works you first need to know the difference between all of them, you can check an in depth difference between them [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientist-vs-data-analyst-vs-data-engineer-1e2514a36d41), but in short, data analyst analyze current condition with the data provided, data scientist search for pattern and predict the future while data engineer ensure that both data scientist and analyst got the cleanliest and most up-to-date data possible from production.

For data scientist and analyst, there are a lot of tool other than Python that you need to learn, but in Python you can start by mastering Pandas. A lot of the time the data will be in a tabular form so practising analyzing with pandas help with the intuition in doing data analytics

For data engineering, it'll be the same with the other two, but you need more expertise in ETL tooling because you are going to churn a lot more data than what pandas is capable of.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning has come to mainstream media recently. The thought of a machine that can learn is something that isn't far fetch.

This is where Python shine, a majority of adopted framework for machine learning used in industries and scientific research is made for Python. The two major framework you need to learn for machine learning is Tensorflow made by Google and Pytorch made by Facebook (Meta). Both of them got their pros and cons, while as of now PyTorch is more frequently used than Tensorflow. Tensorflow is usually found in a production/industry settings, while Pytorch is usually found in research.

The landscape for machine learning kept changing each year, maybe in a few years PyTorch will fall to another library like Tensorflow does a couple years back.

In essence for machine learning you need know a bit more about the math behind it. It may seem difficult at first, but it'll be easier as time progress. After knowing how things work, it'll be easier for you to start using your choice of framework.

You can learn more about Tensorflow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml) and Pytorch [here](https://pytorch.org/)

## Moving Forward

Moving forward, I recommend you all to find courses or bootcamp that goes along with your passion. If you are still in your first year in university you have a long time to prepare, use your time wisely!

You can search courses in Coursera and you can apply for financial aid, you only need to fill a form writing your story (in english), and wait for 2 weeks. I manage to finish a lot of courses in the range of 1 year using this method, and you can try this out! (For further information you can check [here](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US))

With the rise of Kampus Merdeka in Indonesia or simply MBKM, there are a lot of opportunity here and there. You should definitely check Kampus Merdeka [here](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/)

Through MBKM I manage to get myself into Bangkit Academy led by Google, GoTo and Traveloka, this 6 month gave a big impact to my overall view of the industries. I highly recommend to check Bangkit out [here](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/), it'll started at 2023 so you can prepare yourself from now.

About failure, it is okay and fine to fail, fail more and you'll learn more, keep trying new things and keep moving forward.

## What Now?

You've reach the end of the module, you've read/heard everything and hopefully learn things a long the way, you are free to check things out from the beginning to refresh things out.

The best way to practice and learn a programming language is to simply use it, for both homework and personal project, and just never stop learning.

Thank you for sticking all the way, I hope your long journey ahead to the vast landscape of programming either in Python or other language you find on the way will be filled with joy.
